Graph-Convert
=============

Graph::Convert lets you convert graphs between the graph formats
from "Graph" and "Graph::Easy".

It takes a graph object in either format, and converts it to the desired
output format. It handles simple graphs as well as multi-edged graphs,
and also carries the attributes over.

This enables you to use all the layout and formatting capabilities
of "Graph::Easy" on "Graph" objects, as well as using the extensive
graph algorithms and manipulations of "Graph" on "Graph::Easy" objects.

Installation
============

See INSTALL on how to install this module.
