=============

To install this module type the following:

Untar the package:

	tar -xzf Graph-Convert-x.xx.tar.gz

where x.xx is the current revision.

Change into the directory:

	chdir Graph-Convert-x.xx/

Verify the package:

	cpansign --verify

If the package fails to verify, do NOT run Makefile.pl nor install it and
notify me immidiately. YOUR SYSTEM MIGHT GET COMPROMISED! 

When the package verified okay, then proceed:

        perl Makefile.PL

If you get warnings about missing or outdated modules, then
upgrade/install these first. Then run the testsuite:

        make test

If all tests pass, install the package:

        sudo make install
